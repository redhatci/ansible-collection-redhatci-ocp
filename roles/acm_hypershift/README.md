# acm_hypershift role

This role allows the deployment of Hypershift (Hosted Control Planes) through ACM (Advanced Cluster Management).

## Requirements

To execute the acm_hypershift role a running OpenShift cluster and its credentials are required. i.e. through the KUBECONFIG environment variable.

- OpenShift Cluster with ACM operator. Please see [acm_setup](../acm_setup/README.md) role to deploy ACM through a role. The hub must have the following operators already installed:
  - Advanced Cluster Manager
  - Multicluster Engine
  - Metal LB operator is required when using kvirt provider in Bare Metal environments
  - Hyperconvered Operator for kubevirt provider
- A default storage class capabilities for DataVolumes provisioning
- A metalLB instance on baremetal environments
- DNS configuration

### DNS configuration

The API Server for the hosted hypershift cluster is exposed using the LoadBalancer service. All DNS entries required by the Openshift must exist. Example: `api.hypershift.<hub-cluster-domain>`.

These are the required DNS entries to allow interaction with the hosted hypershift cluster:

```Text
<ah_cluster_name>.<ah_base_domain>
api.<ah_cluster_name>.<ah_base_domain>
apps.<ah_cluster_name>.<ah_base_domain>
```

At this time the role supports creating the Openshift required endpoints under the Hub cluster subdomain. Eg: https://console-openshift-console.apps.<hosted-cluster-name>.apps.<cluster-domain>

## Usage Example

See below for some examples of how to use the `acm_hypershift` role

```yaml
- name: Deploy hypershift cluster
  vars:
    ah_cluster_name: hypershift
    ah_ocp_version: 4.14.0
    ah_pullsecret_file: /<path_to_ps>
  include_role:
    name: acm_hypershift
```

## Role Outputs

The following facts can be consumed by other playbooks or roles. In the case of DCI integration, those files will be uploaded to the Job's files section.

```yaml
hypershift_kubeconfig_text: Kubeconfig file for the new cluster.
hypershift_kubeconfig_user: Username for the new cluster.
hypershift_kubeconfig_user: Password for the new cluster.
```
