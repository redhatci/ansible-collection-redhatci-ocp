# This role will mirror a given OpenShift release version to a given cache
# directory.  The directory is supposed to be served behind an HTTP server
# (e.g. apache) so the cluster to be installed can reach it.
# The module will also require an extra container registry to mirror the OCP
# container images.
#
# Parameters:
#   * cache_dir: Base directory that will hold the OCP version binaries and OS
#     images
#   * version: An OpenShift version number e.g. 4.5.21
#   * build: What type of release this is, must be one of: ga, dev, candidate
#   * registry_url: Full docker:// URL pointing to the registry that will
#     hold the mirrored container images e.g. docker://localhost:4000/ns/img
#   * auths: A dictionary holding the combined and well-formed
#     registry authorization credentials for all registries you're pulling
#     images *and* registries you're pushing to
#   * webserver_url: The HTTP server holding/caching the mirrored VM images
#   * force_mirroring (optional): If passed as a true value, the role will
#     re-download all the OCP release resources
