# This is just for v4.3.0, where tar.gz containing all the files for the HTML report was not
# created, so we do it manually.
# We separate this tasks from the others due to three reasons:
# - The destination directory is different, initially.
# - If the job was not launched properly, Javascript files are not generated, so that the third
# task in this block would fail.
# - When removing backwards compatibility, it would be as simple as removing this block.
