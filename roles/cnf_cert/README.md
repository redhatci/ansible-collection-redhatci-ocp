# CNF_cert Role

This role encapulates the logic for the [Test Network Function (TNF)](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test). It is responsible for deploying the TNF framework and running the tests in DCI.

Before executing the CNF (Cloud-native network function) Cert Suite, it's important to label the pods to test using the autodiscovery feature. You can do it manually or programmatically. An example of this can be found in [tnf_test_example](../../samples/tnf_test_example/README.md).

## Example of a tnf_config variable to test pods deployed on multiple namespaces not using label prefixes

The format of the targetpodlabels list has the following format: <label_name>=<label_value>

```yaml
---
tnf_config:
  - namespace: "test-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=test]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
  - namespace: "production-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=production]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
...
```

## Example of a tnf_config variable to test pods deployed on multiple namespaces using label prefixes

The format of the targetpodlabels list has the following format: <label_prefix>/<label_name>=<label_value>

```yaml
---
tnf_config:
  - namespace: "test-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [test-network-function.com/environment=test]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
  - namespace: "production-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [test-network-function.com/environment=production]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
...
```

## How to test operators?

It is allowed to autodiscover operators using custom labels. For this purpose, you can use `targetoperatorlabels` attribute for each `tnf_config` item. Of course this is optional.

Imagine you have an operator labeled as `operator-label=hello` in `test-cnf` namespace. You can autodiscover it by doing the following (just using the first `tnf_config` example showed above for the sake of completeness):

```yaml
---
tnf_config:
  - namespace: "test-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=test]
    targetoperatorlabels: [operator-label=hello]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
  - namespace: "production-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=production]
    targetoperatorlabels: []
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
...
```

If the label value is empty, then just include the label key followed by `=`, for example, using the same label key (the same applies for `targetpodlabels`, in fact, in case we have pods with a label without value):

```yaml
---
tnf_config:
  - namespace: "test-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=test]
    targetoperatorlabels: [operator-label=]
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
  - namespace: "production-cnf"
    targetpodlabels: [environment=production]
    targetoperatorlabels: []
    exclude_connectivity_regexp: ""
...
```

## Example of tnf_env_vars variable

This variable must be a dictionary, where the key is the tnf environment variable to be used during execution. You have some examples of possible variables to be provided in the [tnf docs](https://test-network-function.github.io/cnf-certification-test/runtime-env) or in the [script](https://github.com/test-network-function/cnf-certification-test/blob/main/script/run-container.sh) used to run the tnf container.

For example, the following configuration defines these three environment variables:

- `TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY`: if set to true, skip intrusive tests which may disrupt cluster operations (default `false`).
- `TNF_LOG_LEVEL`: log level used to run the CNF Cert Suite (default `info`).
- `TNF_ALLOW_PREFLIGHT_INSECURE`: (required when running preflight on CNF Cert Suite) if set to true, allow the Preflight execution ran by CNF Cert Suite to access to insecure registries. This should be needed when accessing to private registries. Remember also to turn on preflight test suite with `preflight` label.

```yaml
---
tnf_env_vars:
  TNF_NON_INTRUSIVE_ONLY: true
  TNF_LOG_LEVEL: "debug"
  TNF_ALLOW_PREFLIGHT_INSECURE: true
...
```

Note that cnf_cert role appends to `tnf_env_vars` the environment variables called `TNF_PARTNER_REPO`, `TNF_IMAGE` and `SUPPORT_IMAGE`, as they are defined in runtime. So please **do not define** these variables in `tnf_env_vars`; just let cnf_cert role do its job.

## Some reminders when running preflight with CNF Cert Suite

If you want to run preflight on CNF Cert Suite, you need to: 1) use the proper reference to preflight on `tnf_labels`, 2) define `partner_creds` variable, and 3) properly add `TNF_ALLOW_PREFLIGHT_INSECURE` variable to `tnf_env_vars`.

## Visualize the results with HTML results application.

In the job, starting from tnf v4.4.0 in advance, you will see that a new `tar.gz` file is submitted to the Files section in the DCI jobs. This is called `<timestamp>-cnf-test-results.tar.gz`.

If you extract the compressed files in one single place and open `results.html`, you can see a pre-loaded information extracted from `claim.json` file. If you choose the scenario of your case (telco, extended, etc.), you will see, in Results section, the report of the tnf tests with the corresponding results, having also the opportunity of providing feedback to each test.

It is also possible to provide feedback with `tnf_feedback` variable. You just need to write the feedback for the tests in which you are interested in, and then DCI will take care of pre-load that information in the HTML report.

In [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml), you have a template that you can use in your pipeline file, so that you can fill the value for the tests you want to provide feedback. You don't need to include the tests that you don't want to provide feedback. To insert line breaks, use `\\n` (you need to escape it, else there can be rendering issues). Same for quotes and so on.

In any case, when you finish filling in the feedback in the report, you can generate a new report with that feedback included, by just selecting the scenario you want to evaluate (non-telco, telco, extended...), and pushing in the "Download Results Feedback" button. The resulting HTML resource should be the document to be provided when submitting CNF Certification.

You can also upload a `claim.json` file obtained from the execution (also available in the Files section of the DCI job) in the form you have at the top, if you want to load a different file. Anyway, the report already contains the `claim.json` file.

This is a feature provided by CNF Cert Suite, please check in their documentation for finding more information about this tool.
