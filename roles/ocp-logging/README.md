# ocp-logging role

This role allows enabling the OCP logging subsystem. This allows to aggregate cluster's metrics, application and infrastructure logs. The main components of the stack are:
  - [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) - for logs storage in an Object Storage
  - Clusterlogging - for collecting for logs and metrics
  - Object storage bucket - the permanent logs storage
  - Physical volumes - local storage used for data catching

Main role tasks:
  - Validates the logging subsystem requirements
  - Creates the required secrets
  - Validates that the CustomResources are present
  - Deploys Loki stack
  - Creates a ClusterLogging instance
  - Configures the cluster to forward metrics and logs to the Loki stack
  - Enables the logging-view-plugin for logs visualization for the OCP console

This role only works on OCP 4.10 and newer and with a S3 compatible storage backend.

## Role requirements
  - Cluster-Logging operator already installed
  - Loki-operator already installed
  - Supported Log Store (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure, Swift, Minio, OpenShift Data Foundation) credentials (access_key and access_key_secret)
  - Logs Store endpoint address

## Usage example

See below for some examples of how to use the ocp-logging role to configure the logging subsystem.

Passing the variables at role level:
```yaml
- name: "Setup OCP logging stack"
  include_role:
    name: ocp-logging
  vars:
    ol_access_key_id: <ACCESS_KEY_ID>
    ol_access_key_secret: <ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>
    ol_bucket: loki
    ol_endpoint: http://192.168.16.10:9000
    ol_region: us-east-1
    ol_loki_size: 1x.extra-small
    ol_storage_class: ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd
    ol_event_router_image: "registry.redhat.io/openshift-logging/eventrouter-rhel8:v5.2.1-1"
```

Passing the variables using a yaml vars file:
```yaml
- name: "Setup OCP logging stack"
  include_role:
    name: ocp-logging
  vars:
    ol_settings: <path_to_vars_filel.yml>
```

Remove resources created by the role.
```yaml
- name: "Setup OCP logging stack"
  vars:
    ol_action: 'cleanup'
  include_role:
    name: ocp-logging
```

## Validaton

To confirm that the stack is working properly:
1. Validate that a "Logs" entry has been added to the OCP console under the "Observe" menu.
1. Verify that the Object Storage bucket has started receiving files.

## Troubleshooting

The following are some recommended actions in case there are issues during the deployment.

1. Confirm that all the pods in the `openshift-logging` namespace are running.
1. Confirm that the OCP cluster is able to reach the Object Storage bucket. Check the ingester pods for errors when flushing logs tables.
    ```ShellSession
    $ oc logs -n openshift-logging -f  logging-loki-ingester-0 | grep flush
    level=info ts=2023-06-13T23:55:50.410697776Z caller=flush.go:168 msg="flushing stream" user=infrastructure fp=8532775eba54c8ba immediate=false num_chunks=1 labels="{kubernetes_container_name=\"control-plane-machine-set-operator\", kubernetes_host=\"dciokd-master-2\", kubernetes_namespace_name=\"openshift-machine-api\",
    ```
1. Review that the Console CustomResource has patched to add enable the `logging-view-plugin`.
    ```ShellSession
    $ oc get console cluster -o yaml | grep spec -A4
    spec:
      plugins:
        - logging-view-plugin
    ```
