## GitHub token

Please note that `github_token_path` is required when using `create_operator_project` project. It is used to setup proper permissions in the certification project.

Here are the required token permissions.

## Organization ID

Variable `organization_id` is required when using `create_container_project` project. It is used to validate the existing certification projects in the organization with the same image and registry

For more information of how to retrieve the organization ID see the [Connect Portal API documentation](https://redhat-connect.gitbook.io/partner-guide-for-red-hat-openshift-and-container/appendix/connect-portal-api/project-creation#company-id)
