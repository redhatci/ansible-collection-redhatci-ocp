# Automate creation, update and attach of the Helm Chart Certification Project

This new role `create-helmchart` leverages some existing tasks from the create-certification-project role, promoting reusability and avoiding duplication of effort. Additionally, it introduces new tasks, such as check_if_helmchart_project_exists_same_org and update_helmchart_project, to accomplish specific requirements related to Helm Chart certification.

The associated templates, like create_project_helmchart.json.j2, update_project_helmchart_setting.json.j2 and attach_product_helmchart_listing.json.j2, are now stored within the create-certification-project role instead of being duplicated in the new role create-helmchart. This design ensures efficiency, maintainability, and consistency across the roles.

The current backend behavior for attaching a product listing to newly created cert projects requires that the <old_certs_list> and <new_cert_list> be included. This is because the product listing ID may have been used in both the old and new projects. To address this, we implemented an enhancement to query all old cert projects based on the product listing ID that was used in both lists. We then merged the results into a single array and attached the product listing ID to all of the cert projects.

Note: Previously, users could decide whether to attach a product listing to each cert project. However, this is no longer possible since the `attach_product_listing` parameter is now part of the `cert_listings`.


## Global Variables
As the new role `create-helmchart` reuses some existing tasks such as check_for_existing_projects, create_project and attach_product_listing. Please refer to the description in the `create-certification-project` role for information on the shared global variables.


## Variables to define under cert_settings for Helm Chart

Note: Some variables are not mentioned since they are same as explained in `create-certification-project` role.


## Variables to define for each helmchart_to_certify

Name                     | Default                                                                    | Description

repository               | None                                                                       | If defined, it will be used for chart_name, the value for this `repository` variable can be dummy but please give more meaningful as chart_name
short_description        | None                                                                       | Define when create new Helm Chart and values of this variable is to describe specific detail about this chart


## Variables to define for project settings under `cert_listings` main variable

Name                          | Default                              | Description
